Two different challenges in python to help cut teeth

lots of for loops, variable creation, some conditionals for the second leg of the assignment. Ironically, the poll was done first because it didn't require data to be integers, and strings worked find enough as counts. Code is commented for the blocks done. 

Filepath is very specific for my computer so it required some troubleshooting to work correctly.
